# SmartEdu

• In this project, I created a course system that works with instructor and student roles. Trainers can define their own training in the system after registering and logging in. Students can join or withdraw from these courses after logging in. Both users' personal profiles contain information about the courses they have taken and completed, and only the relevant users can access this information.

• Since I wrote the backend part of this project (I used a ready-made template for the frontend),In general, the technologies I used in the project are;
I used Node.js, express.js, mongoDB, mongoose and bcrypt encryption technology.
